15-puzzle with a console interface by jsuvanto

Actually this is an m*n puzzle where the user gets to set the size of the board.

Once the board is initialized, the user can move the empty tile around or
shuffle the board. There are no win/lose conditions implemented yet.

If the user chooses to shuffle the board, they are prompted to enter how many
times the empty tile should be moved.

Commands:
[u] move the empty tile up
[d] move the empty tile down
[l] move the empty tile left
[r] move the empty tile right
[s] shuffle the board
[q] quit
